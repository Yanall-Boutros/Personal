The pdf files are homework solutions involving fourier series (over discrete sets) and fourier transforms
(the limit as the boundaries of summation/integration go to infinity)

the png files are output from FixIt-Fourier-FixIt.py

the data csv file is contains raw data from the number of fixit tickets issued by day and week
the dc.csv file are the coefficients for the fourier series from the daily data
the wc.csv file contains coefficients for the fourier series from the weekly data

FixIt-Fourier-Fixit.py expresses the data as a fourier series (discrete data set) and *nterms.png
shows the first 10 terms in the fourier series, not superimposed.
