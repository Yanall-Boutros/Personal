A beat exists as a colelction of frequencies which are active at that
instance of time, represented as a square matrix N with basis vectors
of being the complex components from a fourier decomposition. N
has dimensionality OxO

There exists a matrix M, with dimensionality such that the resulting
matrix is 2x2. Take the diagonals to be the values of x and y, and make
recurisve drawing programs from them which manipulates the values of
x and y

* Instead, let there be U number of matrices so that the end result of
applying U matrix transofrmations results in a 2x2 matrix, then, apply
the recursive programs

* Alternativeely, instead of compressing the N matrix and projecting to
a plane of lesser dimensionality, see if it's possible to represent 
a coordinate system to the dimensionality of N, and make recursive
programs draw based on that.

A 3D coordinate system can be imagined as a 2D plane looked in from a 
perspective such that it is infinitessimally thin. Then, rotate that
plane in the direction of its cross product.

Could a 4D coordinate system be abstracted to be the result of a 3D
coordinate system from a hypothetical perspective such that it appears
infintiessimal, then rotate about the cross product of that?

No, but a 2^n dimensional system can (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32...) due to 
quaternions

eg: 1d system, x-> R
    2d system, z-> R+ix
    4d system, z-> R+ix+jy+kz
    8d system, z-> R+ab+cd+ef+gh+ij+kl+mn where b, d, f, h, j, l, and n 
                                                are all quaternions
   etc...

for this particular method to work, n must be a matrix of dimensionality
2^(m) = D(N)
or m = lg(D(N)) is an integer
