The objective is to generate every permutation / sequence of runs that
exist for me to learn on the violin for a set of time signatures (4/4,
3/4, cut time, etc...) fitting inside each beat. Therefore, the sum of 
time for run of notes must equal the length of the beat. For example, 
in 4/4 time the lowest denominator of the beat is a quarter note, which
can be represented as a quarter note, two eighth notes, three tripplets,
four sixteenths, etc...
