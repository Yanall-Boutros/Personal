The objective is to generate every permutation / sequence of runs that
exist for me to learn on the violin for a set of time signatures (4/4,
3/4, cut time, etc...) fitting inside each beat. Therefore, the sum of 
time for run of notes must equal the length of the beat. For example, 
in 4/4 time the lowest denominator of the beat is a quarter note, which
can be represented as a quarter note, two eighth notes, three tripplets,
four sixteenths, etc...

Assuming you're a human with the highest power output of 2000 watts, this
allows for 64 subdivisions in 4/4 time or 128 subdivisions in cut time 
following from physical limits in time-energy uncertainty.

The Rhythym tensor N requires at least three arguments.

N[0][0][3] gives the fourth beat in the 0 lex, 0 measure.
N[0][0] gives the 0th measure of the 0 lex perm, which is [0, 0, 0, 0]
if N[i][j][k] is equal to N itself, that indicates the kth beat is some
value of N[i'][j'][k'] with total length a fourth of the previous beat
if in 4/4 time.

If the calculations from line 9 are accurate, that means the highest
physical depth of this tensor is when N has 64*3 = 192 basis values. With
the last three necessarily being of [i(64') = 0][j(64')] to give the
values of the measure of highest subdivision.
